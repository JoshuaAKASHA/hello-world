## Highlights

- Went through parts of the Playbook with the Cell
- Employees who don't use Internet Explorer/Safari leave their jobs less frequently
- Possibility of getting AKASHA.com and the AKASHA Twitter handle
- Going forwards, YouTube should have tutorial videos and meetups
- [This Tweet](https://twitter.com/mozilla/status/1110597489999208449) was discussed in terms of Retweet-ability; the main comment was that the tone of the Tweet was too downbeat, Anderson's concern was that it was promotion
- When Retweeting things that are not positive, if we want to Retweet them, we quote the Tweet and reframe it
- More created-for-AKASHA images in the collage style would benefit us
- We discussed swearing and how AKASHA team members should act online when speaking as themselves
